These Autostaking Terms is an integral part of the Terms, all the provisions of the Terms shall apply in full and with no reservation except for the provisions contained in this clause 6 related to the way how you may stake your ETHs and receive rewards from the Blockchain. These Autostaking Terms and Autostaking Services are made solely for improvement of your user experience and comfort level increase, do not contain (and are not aimed to) any sort of a guarantee or promise of profitability and/or any other kind of performance, and do not contain or imply any elements of a guarantee or promise of profitability and/or any other kind of performance. For avoidance of any doubts, the Autostaking Services in no way shall be considered as investment contract or any sort of yield, financial or structured product.
   2. Accessing to Autostaking Services you may delegate 32\*x ETH, no partial (pooled) delegation is allowed. Chainbase does not provide any kind of pooling services. In case you have less than specified sum above, please, contact Chainbase team directly.
   3. In order to use Autostaking Services, you shall connect your wallet address (for example, via MetaMask or Wallet Connect) to confirm your withdrawal address and sign/initiate the transaction to deploy and to transfer to the entrance smart contract ("Entrance Smart Contract" or "ESC"). This transaction may include your Staking Rewards Address, address of the ESC deployed by you, addresses of delegated ETHs on the Validator to which ETHs will be transferred ("Delegated Stake Addresses"), and another information that may be deemed necessary. Please note, that these parameters may not be changed after signing/initiating of the transaction. The main purpose of the ESC is to divide all received ETHs in portions of 32 ETHs and transfer thereof to the Delegated Stake Addresses. Neither Chainbase nor you may perform any actions on the ESC, its code and preferences are immutable.
   4. Staking Rewards, if any, come in to your Consensus Rewards Address, if the balance on the Validator(s) exceeds 32 ETH. Please note, that provisions of these Terms do not contain any sort of a guarantee or promise of profitability and/or any other kind of performance, and do not contain or imply any elements of a guarantee or promise of profitability and/or any other kind of performance.
   5. Transactional Fees, if any, shall be distributed by the outgoing smart contract deployed by you ("Outgoing Smart Contract" or "OSC") with the sole condition to share the present rewards between participants' wallets: your wallet address (the same as your Consensus Rewards Address), Chainbase wallet address and the wallet address of the referrer (if the option of referral link is used). The conditions of sharing are based on the provisions of Terms. OSC is immutable with the only one function ‚Äúwithdraw,‚Äù which initiate the process of splitting and sending rewards to the participants' wallets. The withdrawal can be initiated by any participant.
7. **DVT Staking**
   1. Chainbase allows you to use the Validation Services using the SSV network mechanism (Hereinafter referred to as DVT Staking).
   2.  DVT Staking is one of the possible options of the Autostaking Services. The essence of DVT Staking is that several node operators in a cluster (Hereinafter referred to as Node Operators) are involved in the staking process, which to some extent diminishes the likelihood of Slashing, but does not completely eliminate it. This diminishing in this probability occurs only due to a different number of the Node Operators, but not due to the quality of staking or the addition of any other characteristics. You can read more about DVT technology including here:[https://docs.ssv.network/learn/readme](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/readme).

       Please note that during the DVT staking process, you may encounter a notice on the respective Autostaking Services banner indicating that only Chainbase nodes are used. In this case, the cluster will only consist of different Chainbase nodes without involving other operators, and all of the above features of DVT technology are preserved with the difference that all nodes will be Chainbase. By performing DVT Staking in this way you agree to this feature.

       ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT DVT STAKING IS INDICATED ONLY AS A NAME OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS OF AUTOSTAKING SERVICES. THE SSV NETWORK ITSELF (AND THE DVT MECHANISM ITSELF AS A GENERAL NAME OF THE TECHNOLOGY, CONTAINING THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE SSV NETWORK) DOES NOT RELATE TO US IN ANY WAY, WE HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OPERATION OF THIS NETWORK, WE ONLY PROVIDE THE POSSIBILITY OF STAKING WITH FEATURES OF THIS NETWORK. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ISSUES IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND SSV NETWORK.
   3. DVT Staking is a part of a non-custodial Service.
   4. DVT Staking is subject to all provisions of these Terms and Terms of Use posted on the Website until otherwise stated in these Terms or otherwise implied from their provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, Limitation of Liability and Indemnification, Indemnification, Release of these Terms in any case apply to DVT Staking. Chainbase disclaims any other additional warranties or representations regarding DVT Staking.
   5. Chainbase does not represent other Node Operators individually or in the aggregate, and does not bear any responsibility for their actions or inactions.
   6. For the avoidance of doubt, you hereby waive the exercise of any rights, claims, statements, suits, regardless of their nature, that may be brought against Chainbase in connection with any action / inaction of the Node Operators , as well as the recovery of any damages (loss of profits or any direct, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive, consequential or other loss of any kind (including, but not limited to, where related to loss of revenue, income or profit, loss of use or data , loss of use, loss of production, loss of contract, loss of commercial opportunity, loss of savings, discount or rebate (whether actual or anticipated), harm to reputation or loss of goodwill, loss of business, loss for business interruption) in connection with such action or inaction.
