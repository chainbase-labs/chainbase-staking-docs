**The Users‚Äô history**

For security and operations purposes Chainbase may at its sole discretion maintain records of the User's activity on the Website, including, the Website browsing history, records of the User‚Äôs transactions, and other information related to the User‚Äôs activity on the Website.

**Marketing communications**

The User will receive marketing communications from Chainbase if the User has:

1. Requested information from Chainbase or obtained access to the Website and/or the Services; or
2. If the User provided Chainbase with its details and checked the box when entering their details for Chainbase to send the User marketing communications, e.g. when the User obtained access to the Website and/or the Services, or when the User signed up for a subscription (if any); and
3. In each case, the User has not opted out of receiving Chainbase marketing communications.

Chainbase will obtain the User‚Äôs express opt-in consent before Chainbase shares the User‚Äôs Personal Data with any third party for such third party's marketing purposes. Generally, Chainbase does not rely on consent as a legal ground for processing the User‚Äôs Personal Data, other than in relation to sending marketing communications to the User via email. The User has the right to withdraw consent to marketing communications at any time. The User can ask Chainbase to stop sending them marketing emails by following the opt-out or "unsubscribe" links on any marketing message sent to the User or by emailing at

[info@Chainbase.org](mailto:info@p2p.org)

.

Where the User opts-out of receiving our marketing communications, this will not affect Personal Data provided to Chainbase in the course of accessing or using the Website and/or the Services or any other experience referring to and/or applying to the Website and/or the Services.

**Change of purpose**

Chainbase will only use the User‚Äôs Personal Data for the purposes for which Chainbase collected it, unless Chainbase reasonably believes that Chainbase needs to use it for some other reason and that reason is consistent with the original purpose. If you wish to find out more about how the processing for the new purpose is consistent with the original purpose, please do not hesitate to email us for details. If Chainbase needs to use the User‚Äôs Personal Data for a purpose unrelated to the purpose for which Chainbase collected such data, Chainbase will notify the User and explain the legal grounds for processing. Chainbase may process the User‚Äôs Personal Data without the User‚Äôs knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.

**Information from other sources**

As part of Chainbase due diligence process, where it is required by applicable laws, Chainbase may transmit and receive personal information about the User for the purposes of assessing the User fitness to use the Website and/or the Services and to prevent fraud and identity theft.

## **Users‚Äô rights on the collection, use and distribution of Personal Data**

**Opt-In/Opt-Out**

Chainbase allows Users to monitor the way in which Chainbase uses their personal information obtained by Chainbase. All promotional materials P2@ sends to Users (e.g. "newsletters" or "information bulletins") contain internal mechanisms that allow Users to block future mailings (Opt-out, or "unsubscribe").

**Right to access, rectify, modify, erase and object**

Users have the right to request access, rectification, or erasure of their data that Chainbase has collected. Personal Data that was used or is being used for performance of a contract with the User, for data verification purposes cannot be erased upon User‚Äôs demand, and it will be handled in accordance with the governing laws. The User also has the right to object or restrict, for legitimate purposes, the processing of the User‚Äôs Personal Data, as well as the right to data portability. If the User chooses to restrict Chainbase access to Personal Data, Chainbase may be unable to provide certain Services to the User. The User may also withdraw its consent to receive marketing communications and/or share their Personal Data with Chainbase. Users who wish to deactivate their account may do so in accordance with the Terms. Removed information may survive in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to Chainbase and/or other third parties via the Website and/or the Services. The removal of the information and/or Personal Data that was used or is being used for performance of a contract with the User, for data verification purposes cannot be accomplished upon the User‚Äôs demand, and such Personal Data will be handled in accordance with the governing law.

Removed information is retained for Chainbase internal statistic purposes along with the User's history of actions and requests relating to the Website and/or the Services. The User will not have to pay a fee to access their Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights relating to its Personal Data on the Website and/or the Services). However, Chainbase may charge a reasonable fee if the User‚Äôs request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, Chainbase may refuse to comply with the User‚Äôs request in such circumstances. Chainbase may need to request specific information from the User to help Chainbase confirm the User‚Äôs identity and ensure their right to access their Personal Data (or to exercise any of the User‚Äôs other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any unauthorized person. Chainbase may also contact the User to ask the User for further information in relation to the User‚Äôs request to speed up the response. Chainbase will try to respond to all legitimate requests within three month. Occasionally it may take longer if the User‚Äôs request is particularly complex or the User has made a number of requests. In this case, Chainbase will notify the User and keep the User updated. If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email us.

**Data retention**

Chainbase will only retain the User‚Äôs Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes Chainbase collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate Personal Data retention period, Chainbase considers the volume, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the User‚Äôs Personal Data, the purposes for which Chainbase processes the User‚Äôs Personal Data, whether these purposes could be achieved through any other means, and the applicable legal requirements. By law, for accounting and tax purposes Chainbase has to keep basic information about our Users (including contact, identity, and transaction data) for seven (07) years after they cease being Users. In some circumstances Chainbase may anonymize the User‚Äôs Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with the User) for research or statistical purposes, in which case Chainbase may use this information indefinitely without further notice to User.

**Sharing and disclosure of Personal Data**

Sharing and disclosure of Personal Data. Chainbase does not sell its Users‚Äô data to any third party for marketing purposes. Generally, Chainbase will not share Users‚Äô Personal Data with third parties without its Users‚Äô permission. However, since in provision of its Services Chainbase collaborates with various partners, affiliated companies, and third parties, Chainbase may have to share Users‚Äô Personal Data with them.

Chainbase may work with other service providers or third parties to undertake other functions. User information may be shared with these partners in order to maintain and develop the Website and/or provide Services.

**Advertisers**

Chainbase may share its Users' personal information with third-party marketers who provide advertising services on Chainbase behalf. In order to deliver offers and advertisements that may be of interest to the User, Chainbase displays targeted advertisements and Chainbase content on the Services and on other digital properties or applications, and such targeted advertisements and content are based on the information provided to Chainbase by its Users and the information sourced by Chainbase from third parties who have independently collected such information. These advertisers collect and use the information gathered through cookies and other technology, including personal information about User and their devices, in order to provide advertisements about goods and/or services (including our own) that may be of interest to the User. These companies typically use tracking technologies to collect this information, and their use of such technologies is subject to their own terms and privacy practices.

**Legally mandated disclosures**

Chainbase may disclose its Users‚Äô Personal Data if required to do so by law or if Chainbase believes that such actions are necessary to:

1. Conform to the law, comply with a judicial or court order, or comply with the legal process served on Chainbase or its Affiliated parties;
2. Protect and defend Chainbase rights and property, the services, the users of the services, and/or our Affiliated parties;
3. Act under the circumstances to protect the safety and security of the Users of the Website and/or the Services.

Additionally, Chainbase reserves the right to disclose any of the User's Personal Data that it believes is necessary to mitigate liability, comply with audit, regulatory or compliance requirements, defend against claims of third parties, assist government law enforcement agencies, protect the security of the Website and/or the Services, or protect the rights of the Users, Chainbase and Affiliated parties or other parties. Finally, Personal Data may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations on, a merger, consolidation, sale of Chainbase assets, as well as equity financing, acquisition, strategic alliance, or in any other situation where Personal Data may be transferred as one of the business assets of Chainbase.

**International data transfers**

Users‚Äô Personal Data is collected and processed in accordance with the applicable privacy laws and the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Chainbase may share, store, process or attempt to process all Users‚Äô data worldwide. When Personal Data is shared or transferred, Chainbase will ensure that the transfer will be subject to appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable data protection legislation and corresponding level of protection.

**Security**

Chainbase has taken steps to ensure that the Personal Data collected by Chainbase is secure. Chainbase has also taken a range of technical and organizational measures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the Personal Data collected from Users, including protecting Users‚Äô data from unauthorized access, loss, change, or deletion. Personal Data is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible to authorized employees, consultants and/or service providers. Chainbase also has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
