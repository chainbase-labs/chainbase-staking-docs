# üêü Puffer Staking

### **What is Puffer Staking?**

Puffer Staking is an Ethereum-native liquid restaking protocol that allows users to participate in Ethereum‚Äôs Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus with as little as 2 ETH, rather than the standard 32 ETH required to run a validator node. This is made possible through the innovative use of liquid staking tokens and restaking mechanisms powered by EigenLayer, a decentralized service that enables stakers to earn additional rewards by supporting actively validated services (AVS) on top of Ethereum.

### **Key Features of Puffer Staking**

1. **Low Barrier to Entry**:
   * Traditional Ethereum staking requires a minimum of 32 ETH per validator, which can be a significant hurdle for many potential participants. Puffer Staking lowers this barrier by allowing users to stake with as little as 2 ETH, making staking accessible to a broader audience.
2. **Liquid Restaking with EigenLayer**:
   * Puffer Staking integrates with EigenLayer to offer liquid restaking capabilities. This means that stakers can use their already staked ETH to support additional protocols or services without having to unstake it from the Ethereum network. This added layer of utility can lead to higher potential rewards for stakers.
3. **Anti-Slashing Mechanisms**:
   * One of the standout features of Puffer Staking is its robust anti-slashing measures. By using Secure-Signer technology with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Puffer protects validator keys and helps prevent slashing penalties that could occur if a validator behaves maliciously or goes offline. This security feature ensures the integrity of staked ETH and provides peace of mind to stakers.
4. **Validator Tickets (VT)**:
   * Puffer introduces the concept of Validator Tickets (VT), an ERC20 token that grants the holder the right to rent a staker-funded Ethereum validator for one day. Each VT covers one day, during which the holder receives all rewards generated by the validator, including both consensus and execution rewards. VT can be acquired during the validator setup process, providing a flexible and liquid way to manage staking rights.
5. **Points System for Additional Incentives**:
   * Puffer Staking includes a points system designed to incentivize active participation. Users can earn points through engagement with the platform, which may be used for future airdrops or additional rewards. This system offers extra incentives beyond the standard staking yield.
